**Architecture:**

We have extensively used 2D sprites in the making of this game. The game controls collisions, movement and physics through C# scripts. The spaceship moves along with the player's touch count across the screen, while the shoot button will spawn in the projectile which will collide with the asteroid and destroy it.

Asteroids and Powerup are endlessly generated using generators who spawn them in during certain time period. When the ship collides with powerups, their status is activated. If the ship collides with the asteroid then the ship's health is reduced. If health reaches zero, then the scene changes.

There are a total of 4 scenes in the game which can either be changed through buttons or a certain event (like player death).

The game features an energetic and exciting soundtrack that matches the game's fast-paced action. The sound effects are realistic and immersive, enhancing the player's experience.
